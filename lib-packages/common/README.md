# @nw55/common - ts/js library

This is a very basic library with commonly used utlities and types.
I recommend using this library in typescript projects, but it can also be used from plain javascript.
This package has no dependencies on other packages (of course it has devDependencies) and works in any es2019-compatible environment.

With version 0.2 the package was split into mulitple smaller packages.
Until this library reaches version 1.0, there may be frequent breaking changes, but I will try to avoid breaking changes within the same minor version.

Pull requests are welcome, but please open an issue first in case I'm already working on the same thing.

Documentation will (hopefully) be added at a later time.
